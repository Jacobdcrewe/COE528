# COE528
The content of this directory are my projects done in NetBeans from the Object Oriented Analysis and Design course offered at Toronto Metropolitan University.

Lab 1 - a flight management software using the console

Lab 2 - a procedural abstraction program. Finds the factorial of a value that is the product of a factorial (eg. 24), finds the closest factorial value that is not a product of a factorial (eg. 119), determines if a matrix is nice or not.

Lab 3 - a program that queues and dequeues strings in a FIFO order.

Lab 4 - two programs. One that creates/tests for a text file and writes to it and outputs the values to the console. One that outputs the total cost and categories of each food item.

Final Project - A bookstore system. Signing in as admin (user:admin, password:admin) allows you to manage books and users. Signing in as a user allows you to "buy" a book in the software.
